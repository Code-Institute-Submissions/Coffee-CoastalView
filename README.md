# H1 Coffee & Coastal Views 
Coffee & Coastal Views is a web application that contains information about cafes along the Wild Atlantic Way in Ireland. It is a website that allows users to find cafes serving quality coffee in popular tourist locations. Site visitors can browse cafe reviews and ratings or they can make an account and leave their own reviews/rate the cafes. Users can also add cafes to their collection of "want to visit" for easy recall when they are in the area.

Users will also have the ability to, once registered and logged in, edit and delete the reviews and rating they have left previously.

The aims of the site is to create awareness for cafes serving quality coffee along Ireland's coast. 

Users will be able to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) functions across the site. 

Site visitors will also be allowed to fill out a form if they would like a new cafe added to the site. The site will then be added by admin.

# H1 Deployment
I used Visual Studio to write, test and run my code before merging this code onto Gitpod for the purpose of this project. 
On completion of each section I committed the work to GitHub. From the Github platform, I deployed the project to a hosting platform. The project is hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/); in order to make the project go live, I had to insure I had the correct settings employed in Gitpod/Heroku. I used git in the command line and followed the instructions supplied by Heroku. Once activated my site was available at the following address: (https://coffee-coastal-view.herokuapp.com/).
